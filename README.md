Clone is intended to be a business professional connector application. 

Allowing for like minded people to connect to each other for business/development chats and meet ups!

I want all users to be able to find a "Mentor" so to speak to be able to find someone to help them with their goals, or work on their goals togher!

This first came to my mind when I wanted to find someone to desperately teach me and guide me in the right direction.
I really needed help learning how to code and develop, as well as understand how to run and own a business! 
I couldn't find anyone! That is where I came up with the idea of creating this app Clone.

This app will tackle a bunch of different industies and personal interests such as but not limited to:

1.Software Engineering/Computer Programming
2.Computer Games
Computer Hardware
Coputer Networking
IT Secuirty
Consumer Electronics
Business Development
Start Ups(tech or not tech)
Entertainment(Music)
Graphic Design
Real Estate
Think Tanks
Civil Engineer
Law(Pratice, Enforcement, services)

Not only will users be paired up with the right person by their industry but also by their person Interests.

For Example if I was to sign up I would chose Software Engineering as my industry and underneath the umbrella of Software Engineering I would choose a handful of interests. Such as: Javascript, React Native, Start Ups, Mobile App Development, Mobile Design

## Clone is intended to be a business professional connector application. 

Allowing for like minded people to connect to each other for business/development chats and meet ups!

I want all users to be able to find a "Mentor" so to speak to be able to find someone to help them with their goals, or work on their goals togher!

This first came to my mind when I wanted to find someone to desperately teach me and guide me in the right direction.
I really needed help learning how to code and develop, as well as understand how to run and own a business! 
I couldn't find anyone! That is where I came up with the idea of creating this app Clone.

## This app will tackle a bunch of different industies and personal interests such as but not limited to:

* Software Engineering/Computer Programming
* Computer Games
* Computer Hardware
* Coputer Networking
* IT Secuirty
* Consumer Electronics
* Business Development
* Start Ups(tech or not tech)
* Entertainment(Music)
* Graphic Design
* Real Estate
* Think Tanks
* Civil Engineer
* Law(Pratice, Enforcement, services)

Not only will users be paired up with the right person by their industry but also by their person Interests.

For Example if I was to sign up I would chose Software Engineering as my industry and underneath the umbrella of Software Engineering I would choose a handful of interests. Such as: Javascript, React Native, Start Ups, Mobile App Development, Mobile Design

# What is done

* Facebook login with firebase
* Facebook loads and grabs profile picture and places it on the profile page.
* A distance slider that changes the distance that users profiles will populate (working with firebase) filter by location
* Card Matches, swiping and animations that knows when a user has liked or not liked another user to properly create a match and start a chat.
* Gifted Chat that is only available when two users match and then you are able to speak to the user through there.(back by firebase)
* Firebase Security
* Lockdown Users and Location
* Lockdown Relationships
* Lockdown Messages
* Accessing User Location
* Navigation

# ToDo

* Implement Redux
* Adding headers
* Creating a business professional layout and design
* Add a ListView of fields on the profile page (fields being: interests, work history, bio, education) then relate this to the card matches
* Add settings button to the profile page(top right of header)
* Add two buttons and a header to the Matches screen. One for profile, one for messages.
* Create a screen for upon sign in that shows what the app is all about and how to use it(scrolling horizontally)
* Add two buttons to the Login screen. Sign in with Linkedin, and Sign in with Email.
* Create a Terms of Use and Privacy Policy area both before sign in of the app and inside of settings.
* Push notifications, for messages, as well as updates, and to keep user engaged.

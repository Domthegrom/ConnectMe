## Clone is intended to be a business professional connector application. 

Allowing for like minded people to connect to each other for business/development chats and meet ups!

I want all users to be able to find a "Mentor" so to speak to be able to find someone to help them with their goals, or work on their goals togher!

This first came to my mind when I wanted to find someone to desperately teach me and guide me in the right direction.
I really needed help learning how to code and develop, as well as understand how to run and own a business! 
I couldn't find anyone! That is where I came up with the idea of creating this app Clone.

## This app will tackle a bunch of different industies and personal interests such as but not limited to:

* Software Engineering/Computer Programming
* Computer Games
* Computer Hardware
* Coputer Networking
* IT Secuirty
* Consumer Electronics
* Business Development
* Start Ups(tech or not tech)
* Entertainment(Music)
* Graphic Design
* Real Estate
* Think Tanks
* Civil Engineer
* Law(Pratice, Enforcement, services)

Not only will users be paired up with the right person by their industry but also by their person Interests.

For Example if I was to sign up I would chose Software Engineering as my industry and underneath the umbrella of Software Engineering I would choose a handful of interests. Such as: Javascript, React Native, Start Ups, Mobile App Development, Mobile Design
